# Summary

The purpose of this library is to facilitate working with geographical raster data accessible using idiomatic C++, foremost the range based for-loop introduced in C++11. The advantage of that is that it becomes possible to use standard programming techniques and C++ libraries on raster data. The library is intended to especially useful for environmental modelling, including Cellular Automata modelling, spatial statistics and multi-scale analysis.
