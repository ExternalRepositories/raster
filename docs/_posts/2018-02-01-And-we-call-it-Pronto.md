title:  "And we call it Pronto"
---
The library has now been renamed from Blink Raster to Pronto Raster. It will take me some time getting used to the new name, but it was felt a rename was necessary to avoid any confusion with the Chromium [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink) library. If you are ever looking for a nice short name for a product that is short, positive sounding and has no negative connotations or is already used in a related field: good luck! I feel more sympathy now for those poor marketeers who have to come up with new names for car models or insurance products.
