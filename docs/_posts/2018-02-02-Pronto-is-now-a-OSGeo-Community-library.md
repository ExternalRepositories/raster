The Incubation committee of OSGeo has [accepted](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/incubator/2018-February/003548.html) Pronto Raster as a community library. It is great to now be a member of the OSGeo family and I hope this will be a first step to greater community involvement in the development of the library.
